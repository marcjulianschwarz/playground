# Playground

Hello curious person. If you've stumbled across this repo you can safely ignore it :)

This is my playground. Here, I learn, experiment and have fun. All code that didn't make it into its own repository will end up here.
Everything here is "as-it-is" with lots of untested, sometimes not even runnable and often rather bad looking code.

So, brace yourself ;)
